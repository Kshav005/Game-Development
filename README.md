# Game-Development
A set of programs explaining all the basics regarding pygame module of python

You can learn pygame in few minutes using this whole file I made. The tutorial focuses more on snake game than the tutorial but I have tried my best to create chapters for each topic. Have fun learning!
Actually the files are little unorganized but I have labeled everything with a number. The mp3 files are all music created by me for game music. While I added some images as well to show which images I used to make it look like a pro. I tried my best to give it a retro look like mario and pacman by using that kind of synth music and the pixel font of course. That's all. Next project will be web development!
